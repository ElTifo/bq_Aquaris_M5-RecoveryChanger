# bq_Aquaris_M5-RecoveryChanger

<b>Android Studio Project - Recovery Changer App for bq Aquaris M5</b>

This app is compatible with any ROM for M5.

Tested on: Official Nougat 5.0.0

All Recovery files are included inside the apk so there's no need to download the recovery img files and flash them on the device like before.

This project is a "clone" of https://github.com/ElTifo/bq_Aquaris_E5_FHD-RecoveryChanger but, since the goal of the app is to change the recovery for this specific device, I decided to create a new project instead of commiting changes to a new branch on the other project (which is meant for bq Aquaris E5 FHD).
